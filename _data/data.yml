# Profile
profile: |
  I am a hardworking professional and I believe that young people are important in the job market, because with their energy, ease of understanding and willingness to learn, they can help in the development of the company. In this way, I hope to accumulate experiences that will be applied in the future, after completing technical or higher education.
